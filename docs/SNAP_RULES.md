# Snap design rules

Code cites these by ID, e.g. `// SNAP-R3: faces show outcomes`. Each rule has a one-line statement, why it exists,
and where the full story lives. Study docs are in the research folder
the Snap study notes (local to Dylan's machine): LESSONS.md, MODEL_SWITCHING.md,
MODEL_GRAPH_ONBOARDING.md, UX_SPEC.md, CONCEPT.md.

When a rule changes, edit it here and keep its ID. Retired IDs stay listed as "retired", so old comments still resolve.

## Graph and generic behaviour

- **SNAP-R1: Generic pass-through, never per-node code.** Snap reads what a node exposes: widget types, options,
  limits, upload flags, DOM panels, previews, wiring. A pack node may offer a small interface that Snap reads
  generically (`node.presets`). Curated pack bricks only choose which values show on their face.
  *Why:* there are thousands of custom nodes; Snap must work with all of them. *More:* LESSONS "Generic pass-through".
- **SNAP-R2: The graph is the source of truth, and edits round-trip both ways.** The workflow stays plain ComfyUI plus
  `extra.snap`. Anything edited in the graph view (a value, a swapped node, a new upscaler) shows up sensibly in Snap.
  Anything that shows a widget's value re-reads it when the widget changes, from any source (graph, agent, another
  panel). *Why:* the stale side panel and the old Dial Rack both showed wrong data as current. *More:* LESSONS
  "kept its own copy of rows".
- **SNAP-R3: A value that doesn't resolve stays visible as missing.** Never silently drop it or let a default stand
  in. A file that's listed but unreadable is missing too. Basename matching (one unique match in any sub-folder) is
  the only allowed resolution. *Why:* the recipe once looked fine while it would have rendered the wrong models.
  *More:* MODEL_SWITCHING §5.

## Faces and interaction

- **SNAP-R4: Faces show outcomes in the person's terms.** Each decision gets one control. Never show what the brick's
  presence already implies. Example: Upscale shows `1280×704 → 2560×1408` and `Off · 2× · 4×`, not the model variant
  and a scale number, and Render says nothing about upscaling. Implementation details (model variant, tiers, knobs)
  live in the inspector. *More:* MODEL_GRAPH_ONBOARDING §7.
- **SNAP-R5: Start/new never touches open work.** Starting a recipe on a non-empty graph, or switching model family,
  opens a new tab. In a scene tab, opening another shot saves the open one into its scene first (SNAP-R24). *More:*
  LESSONS "Start/new".
- **SNAP-R6: Panels close only when the person asks.** The side panel collapses from its header button (the brick's
  icon + ›) or Esc, never from presses on the chain, empty space or a scrollbar. *Why:* a pointerdown on a scroll
  container also fires for its scrollbar. *More:* LESSONS.
- **SNAP-R7: Lists that can re-render keep their elements while a pointer is down.** ComfyUI checks for graph changes
  on every mouseup/keyup and re-renders Snap, so a toggle on pointerup survives where a click does not. *More:* LESSONS
  "ComfyUI frontend traps".
- **SNAP-R8: Judge UI from real screenshots, as a product.** Green tests are not enough. Test with realistic data
  sizes (83 dials, 900 LoRAs).

## Models, setups, LoRAs

- **SNAP-R9: Setups own the whole model set.** A setup covers diffusion model, encoder + type, VAEs and core LoRAs.
  Applying one is a single undo step. In Snap the setup's bricks (Models + Render Preset; the image kit's Models + Core
  LoRAs) show as one Setup brick: family · model · turbo on its face, Models and Sampling sections when opened. The
  graph and the engine keep them separate (SNAP-R2); moving, removing or selecting the card acts on all of them. A family mismatch (e.g. an encoder type that doesn't fit the model) is shown,
  not left as an empty family. *More:* MODEL_SWITCHING §4.
- **SNAP-R10: Turbos are either merged into a checkpoint or are LoRAs.** Don't add a turbo LoRA on a turbo merge unless
  the person asks. Stacking N LoRAs, including 2-3 turbo LoRAs at lower strengths, is normal. Swapping turbos is one
  chip. *More:* MODEL_GRAPH_ONBOARDING §2.
- **SNAP-R11: Warn and explain, never block.** Mismatches, odd stacks and degraded settings get a warning; the
  workflow still runs (ComfyUI AGENTS.md "User Input Tolerance"). An optional input with nothing to give is off, not
  a failure: First frame starts bypassed until it has a picture (the H3 Render's first frame is optional, so the run is
  text to video); a fresh recipe on a server with an empty input folder used to fail LoadImage's validation.
- **SNAP-R12: LoRAs have roles.** The roles are core (turbo / fix / task / hires / edit / control), style, identity
  and dial. Each role has its own home:
  - core rows go with the setup;
  - style rows go with the shot or recipe;
  - identity rows go with character cards;
  - dials go in the Dial Rack.

  Unknown LoRAs ask once, and the answer is remembered. Identity LoRAs are private by default: never exported or
  shown on shared pages. *More:* MODEL_GRAPH_ONBOARDING §6.
- **SNAP-R13: Family rules come from the model graph, not code branches.** These include: MOSS SFT always carries a
  deband fix; MOSS Base wants long, concrete prompts, and its prompt expander ("✨ Enhance prompt (LLM)" on the
  Render) stays off by default because it can drop details; Krea Raw int8 is `int8_rowwise` and can't load in core.
  Pack entries are in `snap_cards/models.json`, and the person's own entries win. *More:* MODEL_GRAPH_ONBOARDING §1.
- **SNAP-R14: A method slot (upscale, turbo, and later others) is a chip over interchangeable implementations.** All
  share one face shape. A method wired in by hand in the graph still shows up, recognised by its wiring (one media
  input and the same type out), never by its name. Slots and methods are data: `snap_cards/methods.json` under the
  person's `snap/methods.json`. Render blueprints give their media (IMAGE, or H3's VIDEO with its sound), so a media
  slot is the bricks between the Render and Save; a workflow saved with the older H3 Render (Save and the RelayVSR switch
  inside it) runs as saved and offers a one-press upgrade. *More:* MODEL_GRAPH_ONBOARDING §7, scout/upscalers, UX_GEMS §5.

## Sets and continuity

- **SNAP-R21: A shot's reference picture shows that shot's own camera.** H3 copies whatever picture it is given, view
  included: one wide plate as every shot's reference became the wrong view in 8/12 takes (U21), a per-shot picture the
  right one 12/12 (U48). So a set keeps one people-free plate per camera, made by an orbit pass from its wide plate
  (H3 Ref2V, "the camera is not where <Picture 1> was taken" plus that camera's doors and windows). One render per
  camera is unreliable (U49 moved off the plate 8/9, U52 pass 1 copied 3/3), so each camera gets 2-3 renders as
  candidates (SNAP-R23) and the person picks. The copy score (DINOv3 patch tokens matched by grid position, threshold
  from the model graph: 0.72) marks a likely copy of the wide plate's view and the layout check says where each door,
  window and prop landed against the plan; neither rejects (push-ins score 0.56-0.68, like new views at 0.50-0.66).
  A shot that compiles with no plate for its camera gets its candidates made then; opening a scene's card shot with no
  plate offers them as a proposal (GPU time nobody asked for by opening it); "make all" does every camera. Each
  plate records its take, frame, copy score, seed, camera, who made it and who picked it; the person can swap any
  plate. The shot compiler sends the shot's plate with "seen from this camera", falls back to the wide plate with "the
  camera is not where <Picture N> was taken", and uses a plate as FL2V's first frame only when the shot card asks to
  start on that exact frame. A plate stops counting once its camera moves. The same score flags a take that copied its
  own reference picture's view (DINOv3's room score can't). *More:* U48_PER_SHOT_PLATES §3 and U49, `web/snap/plates.js`,
  `web/snap/checks.js`, `MAISnapCopyScore`.
- **SNAP-R22: Doors and windows are said from the shot's camera.** The set card names each opening and its wall (from
  the plan geometry); the set block says where each is for this camera ("the tall window in the east wall is on the
  right", "the door in the south wall is behind the camera, out of view"), computed, never typed per shot. *Why:* with
  props only, H3 and MOSS put the window on the wrong wall in every reverse shot of U21 and U48. *More:* `setsnap.js`
  `openings`.

- **SNAP-R23: A decision with several possible results shows them as candidates before anything changes.** Camera
  plates, an edit's anchor frames and later any "make N, keep one" step hold N candidates, each with its provenance
  (take, frame, seed, by) and pre-screen notes (copy score, layout against the plan, identity). The person previews a
  candidate in place (the plate slot or the take viewer shows it; nothing is edited), applies one (one step Undo takes
  back) or rejects one. A check only leaves a note: it never rejects alone, because every score so far overlaps between
  right and wrong somewhere. An edit's identity notes are two flags with thresholds from the model graph: "probably a
  different person" (ArcFace on a crop around SAM 3.1's face mask, cosine below `identity_check.different_person`, U56)
  and "hair lighter than original" (SAM 3.1's hair mask, lit-hair L* p90 over the take's own frames above
  `hair_check.lighter`, U56b). An edit whose method `does` something in `identity_check.unreliable_for` (relighting:
  the same woman scores 0.34-0.60 at night) shows its cosine as "face check unreliable under relighting" and never the
  different-person flag. Both miss things (dark frames and profiles score low, blonder hair doesn't show), so the
  head crops sit beside them and decide. Agents list and pre-screen candidates and recommend one; their apply / reject / undo waits
  for the person as a proposal unless "Let agents run" is on (SNAP-R16), and every pick records who made it (SNAP-R17).
  Any take's frame can be used as an input (First frame or a reference picture), and the brick remembers which take
  and frame it came from. *Why:* U49 and U52 showed one render per camera is unreliable, and U53b's edits drifted the
  person's hair; Krita's preview-then-Apply, Invoke's staging area and Runway's "use as input" (UX_GEMS #2).
  *More:* `web/snap/candidates.js`, `candidateview.js`, `edits.js`.

## Scenes

- **SNAP-R24: Scenes own the work; tabs are scratch.** A scene (user `snap/scenes/<id>.json`) is a document: a name,
  a set card, and its shots in order. Each shot has the workflow Snap keeps for it (`snap/scenes/<scene>/<shot>.json`),
  the take groups it gathers (graph ids, as takes record them), its takes by id with versions nested through their
  parent take (a night version, a take continued from another's last frame), and one active take. Takes keep their own
  store; a run in a shot's workflow or an edit of one of its takes joins the shot by itself. Opening a shot saves the
  open shot first and goes to a tab that already shows it (from a scratch tab, to the scene's own tab), then swaps the
  graph there. A scratch tab, or the tab of a saved workflow file, is never swapped (its next save would write another
  shot into that file): the shot opens in a new tab. Adopting a workflow's takes copies its graph with its id, so its
  take group keeps working, and leaves the workflow as it was. Above the chain the navigator shows where the tab is
  (Scene › Shot › Take › version, ending on the active take) and the scene's shots; in a scene tab the Takes strip is
  the shot's takes tree. The active take is the person's pick; an agent's waits as a proposal (SNAP-R16). Renaming
  and deleting delete nothing: a shot taken out of a scene stays in the scene's file under `removed` (its takes listed,
  its workflow file kept), and a deleted scene's document is parked in `snap/scenes/_parked/<id>.json` with its shot
  workflows and takes where they were; an agent's remove waits for the person. Switching model family inside a shot
  opens a scratch tab outside the scene, and the setups sheet says so (whether it should stay as a version of the shot
  is Dylan's open question). Ids are
  stable and the shots ordered; lanes and in/out on shots and takes come with the sequence editor (layer 3).
  *Why:* takes grouped by the workflow's own id, so a scene's shots and their variants scattered over tabs
  (NEXT_DESIGN_REVIEW §10 Q2); Dylan (2026-11-04): "a scene should have the related work navigable and nested".
  *More:* `web/snap/scenes.js`, `web/snap/sceneview.js`; PLAN U59, scout/editor_layer §5.6-5.7.

## Onboarding

- **SNAP-R25: Onboarding proposes; it never downloads.** "I'm new, help me set up" asks at most five things, each with a
  default and Skip: what to make, look through the models, metadata in outputs (it sets the SNAP-R20 switch), SFW only,
  and which tasks may use API models (none by default). Hardware is read from `/system_stats`, never asked. Answers go
  in user `snap/profile.json`, saved per step, so it resumes; reopened it asks only what's new ("Add a capability").
  It ends on a kit per intent: the recommended setup for this machine (ready first, then one whose missing files all
  have a download), a fast option, alternatives on request, each with good-at, VRAM fit and an evidence grade with a
  date (measured on this machine / community-measured / community opinion / untested); "Open in new tabs" opens one
  recommended setup per intent (SNAP-R5). Kits are data (`snap_cards/kits.json`): they name setups, and a file's
  folder, size, source, link and license come from the model graph, a method's needs from the method registry. What's
  missing is listed with exact files, sizes, targets and a command, node packs with author, repo, license and our
  safety read (network at import, pickles, auto-downloads); the person or their agent runs them after a yes. API
  setups appear only for tasks the person allowed. SFW only hides files, dials, LoRAs and Library cards the model graph
  tags `nsfw` from pickers and agent tools; it's a preference filter on the person's own tags, and the UI says so.
  *Why:* AGENTS.md "No Internet Requests"; Dylan (2026-11-04): intent first, light touch, metadata asked here.
  *More:* MODEL_GRAPH_ONBOARDING §4 and §8, `web/snap/onboarding.js`, `onboardview.js`, `profile.js`.

## Agents

- **SNAP-R15: Every UI action has an agent tool.** MCP and WebMCP are built from one table. Results carry the same
  warnings the UI shows. *More:* LESSONS "Agents, WebMCP, tools".
- **SNAP-R16: GPU-spending tools wait as proposals** unless the person turns on "Let agents run". (Not gated:
  `find_people` and `take_frames`, which render nothing: a few seconds of detection or frame reading.) Each one states its
  plan first: what it would run and about how long, in seconds from measured takes (or the study it came from), shown
  with the proposal and returned with the run (plan-then-approve, UX_GEMS #5). The bridge never strands the person's
  tab; it calls the newest tab that is still connected.
- **SNAP-R17: Keep person and agent labels apart** (`by: person|agent`) on notes, judgments and takes. The data trains
  a judge model.
- **SNAP-R19: The tool table is the API.** Snap's own UI, agents (MCP/WebMCP) and a future form-based editor layer
  drive the same operations through one table. Engine and tool logic stay free of Snap-view DOM concerns; a UI action
  calls the same function its tool calls, never a private path. *More:* CONCEPT.md "Layers".

## Data and privacy

- **SNAP-R18: Local only.** No network or telemetry: registry, takes, profile and model graph are local files. Export
  happens only when the person asks. Model downloads run only when the person asks, in the agent's own tools, never
  from ComfyUI core.
- **SNAP-R20: Metadata in saved files is the person's switch; private takes are marked.** Saved pictures and videos
  keep their prompt and workflow by default, as core saves them. "Save metadata", the switch right before Run (a ComfyUI
  user setting, `MAINodes.Snap.SaveMetadata`, remembered per user), turns that off: every prompt the page queues then
  carries `extra.snap_metadata: false` in its workflow, and the server swaps core's Save Image / Preview Image / Save
  Video for twins that write no prompt or workflow, and refuses, before anything runs, any other node that would write
  them. No warning chip. A take is private when any node of its prompt loads a file the model graph gives role
  `identity` or tags `private`, whose real path (symlinks followed) is under one of the person's private paths or
  matches one of their private patterns (user `snap/private.json`, local, never in the pack and never read by the
  page), or when Snap's Cast brick has a LoRA row on; it is NSFW when it loads a file tagged `nsfw`. Reasons name nodes,
  never files. The take card shows a lock, and the export leaves private and NSFW takes out unless asked
  (`--include-private`, `--include-nsfw`). A person's model graph or private.json that doesn't parse makes every prompt
  private. *Why:* core writes the executed prompt and workflow, LoRA file names included, into every PNG and mp4, and
  `--disable-metadata` is global; Dylan chose metadata on for everything with one clean switch (2026-11-04) over
  stripping private takes automatically. *More:* `snap_privacy.py`, `snap_bridge.py`, `web/snap/metadata.js`; PLAN U22, U58.
